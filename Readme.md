# happy mrs chicken

(german name: "Das Huhn hat zu tun")

This is going to be an implementation of the game "Happy Mrs. Chicken" from
the childen television series "Peppa Pig"

One of the game goals is to teach younglings what it means to be a programmer :)

All of the graphics and sounds will be self-made, so hopefully there won't be
any copyright problems! If there is a problem, please create an issue.

## current state

 - you can spawn chicken by clicking or tapping
 - the canvas should be the full page
 - the page can be installed as PWA

## very rough roadmap

Since our customer did not provide a specification sheet for this project, we
choose an agile approach. The plan is to develop a prototype early on, in order
to give the customer a first impression. After that, they will be
incorporated into each development cycle, as well as the acceptance tests.

- [x] draw picture on fullscreen canvas
- [x] draw pictures on input event
- [x] browser campatibility (webapp)
- [ ] sprites / animations
- [ ] sound
- [ ] first game mechanics
  - [x] rough game loop
  - [ ] lay egg on tap
  - [ ] move somewhere else
- [ ] text, debug stats
- [ ] game state, intro screen, end screen
- [ ] game mechanics finalisation
- [ ] levels? Faster movement?
