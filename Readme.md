# happy mrs chicken

(german name: "Das Huhn hat zu tun")

This is going to be an implementation of the game "Happy Mrs. Chicken" from
the childen television series "Peppa Pig"

One of the game goals is to teach younglings what it means to be a programmer :)

All of the graphics and sounds will be self-made, so hopefully there won't be
any copyright problems! If there is a problem, please create an issue.

## current state

You can spawn chicken by clicking or tapping; the canvas should be the full page.
